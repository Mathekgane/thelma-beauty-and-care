        Thelma Beauty and Care was founded in May 2023 by Thelma Mahlangu, a passionate and determined entrepreneur from Hammanskraal. With the high unemployment rate and limited access to affordable beauty products in her community, Thelma saw an opportunity to create a business that not only meets a real need but also empowers local people. Starting from her own home, Thelma began sourcing quality beauty products directly from Johannesburg at low prices. Her mission is clear: to provide affordable, high-quality hair and nail care products that help men and women care for their natural hair without breaking the bank. By accepting both cash and card payments, Thelma ensures her customers have convenient options to purchase their favorite products. For reliable and closely connected individuals, she also offers the opportunity to buy products on credit and pay back at the end of the month. This approach has helped her build strong trust within her community, as many people can now access the beauty items they need without traveling long distances or paying high prices. Thelma‚Äôs story is an inspiring example of how passion, determination, and a simple idea can build a successful business that serves a vital community need.
